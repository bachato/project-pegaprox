        "Important: Due to high demand, PegaProx releases will now be weekly due to shortage of our capacity to handle support requests. Please wait patiently.",
        "Added: SDN (Software Defined Networking) Management - view and manage zones, vnets, subnets, controllers, IPAM, and DNS (GitHub Issue #38)",
        "Added: Easy Setup Multipath support for ISCSI",
        "Added: Remove Node from Cluster - runs pvecm delnode with automatic cleanup of stale config on removed node via SSH",
        "Added: Move Node to another Cluster - automated 3-step flow: remove from source, cleanup, force join to target",
        "Added: SSH multipath detection with credential fallbacks for cluster operations",
        "Added: Node IP resolution via vmbr0 bridge interface - more reliable than hostname/DNS lookup in multi-network setups",
        "Added: Support Bundle generation for troubleshooting",
        "Added: API Token Management - create, list, and revoke Bearer tokens for programmatic access (scripts, CI/CD, monitoring)",
        "Added: Storage Rescan functionality",
        "Fixed: SSE/Taskbar oscillation bug in 'All Clusters' view causing excessive re-renders",
        "Fixed: Node IP resolution now happens BEFORE pvecm delnode to prevent cleanup running on wrong node",
        "Fixed: Taskbar expand icon changed from ChevronUp to ChevronDown (thanks @gyptazy)",
        "Improved: Node removal buttons relocated from maintenance-start dialog to maintenance-completed section (logical flow)",
        "Improved: Offline node check changed from blocker to warning (pvecm delnode runs on remaining online node, not target)",
        "Improved: Force Join checkbox always visible with auto-check when old config detected",
        "Improved: Cleanup scripts use killall -9 for reliable pmxcfs termination"
